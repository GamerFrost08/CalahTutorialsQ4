	<div class="demo">
		<h1 align= center> What were the things well done during the stream? </h1>
			<center><p> There are multiple things that went well during the stream. 
Our internet connection was good while we were doing our stream. In the first stream our internet was lagging and caused the stream to crash, unlike our second stream where our wifi was stable and we didn’t have to split the stream. 
Our first topic was discussed well to our viewers, we engaged well with them for our first part of the stream. The first stream we did, we were very messy and didn’t know what to say, which is why we say that in our second stream we were more organized and well-versed in our topic now. 
Our interview went well with our invited guest, since they were able to share their own perspective to our viewers. We didn’t have any stories to share to the viewers other than our own and having a guest interview really helped us connect with the viewers more.
</p>

	<div class="demo1">
		<h1 align= center> What are the areas of opportunities for your stream? </h1>
			<center><p> The areas of opportunities for our stream: I think that they are areas of opportunities because it makes our stream more lively and interesting to our viewers.
Our time management skills, we had a hard time in ending discussions since we were too into it already and wanted to keep going. 
Our positioning during the stream could have been better and more organized since there were moments where we’d stand up or move around and sometimes get cramped and hit each other. 
</p>

			<center><p>Our stream had high levels of engagement from our viewers, we really tried to entertain any questions and asked questions throughout, we tried our best to make the stream entertaining for our audience, since we wanted them to not only learn but to ask questions in the process. We also interviewed our guest with our audiences during our stream, and we answered our audience questions about our topic for those who are struggling, to make our audiences more clearly in our stream topic. 
 
</p>
	</div></center>
	
	<div class="demo8">
		<h1 align= center> How did the level of engagement affect the overall performance of the stream? </h1>

Our audience enjoyed our stream, we explained our answers to them, we explained our topic to them and we entertained our audience. Our stream went well and our level of engagement is high. 
 
</p>
	</div></center>
	
		<div class="demo5">
