		<h1 align= center> Our Stream's Goals </h1>
			<p> We plan to produce tutorials that can help others to their best ability. We want to be able to give ideas on how others can do something or improve at something. We want our stream to be a place where people can learn something and can actually be helped by it. We would like to be able to connect to the students as well since our streaming content is tutorials mostly for students on how they could spend their time on how they could do things. We can describe this stream to be informative to the viewers who are going to watch. Not only that but it will also be entertaining since what we are going to discuss in the stream is not only a very present issue right now but most people will likely relate to it. We may also characterize our stream as intuitive because, in addition to the provided knowledge, we also offer advice and pointers on topics that may enlighten some while educating others.</p>
			<p> As a streaming channel, we want to improve our viewers' lives academically and in their gaming life. We make tutorials based on how to balance academics and gaming with the "work hard, play hard" mindset. Though we do that, we also give them ways to have a healthy schedule when it comes to gaming and doing schoolworks so that our minds would be able to take a break and rest. </p>
