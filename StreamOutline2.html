			<center><p>As you can see from the table above our stream would last only 1 hour in which we would be able to discuss all the topics that came prepared in that time period. A greeting and a short recap that would only take 5 minutes to welcome old and new viewers, 15 minutes to discuss on the positive effects in gaming and new techniques to help improve ones life in gadgets. A 5 minute intermission to ensure the audience wouldn't get bored while preparing for the next topic, a 10 minute Guest Interview to ask an outsiders point of view on the topic in games. 20 minutes in playing a game that the Guest requested us to play in abundance on the Positive Effects discussed earlier, while also entertaining the audience so as to not get bored. Lastly a 5 minute Conclusion in order to wrap up and summarize the stream to the audience.
